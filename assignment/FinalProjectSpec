# Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I would like to create a web application that visualizes real estate values
around New York City subway lines. Interactivity built into the application will allow for the user
to select specific subway lines - or even subway stops and see the median rent in the neighborhood, likely
based on the surrounding census tracts.

## Problem / Question

The application seeks to highlight the relationship between real estate values and transit stops
in New York City. Interactivity within the application will allow users to visually explore data on their
own and understand neighborhood real estate values on a line-by-line or stop-by-stop basis. Ideally the application
will bring to light some surprising relationships between properties and transit proximity, and will highlight
both the most and least affordable neighborhoods to live in New York City.

## The data

1. New York City Subway lines: currently available in GEOSJON format on the NYC Open Data portal.
2. New York City Subway stops: currently available in GEOJSON format on the NYC Open Data portal.
3. 2015 ACS Data: I can create a shapefile containing median rental prices at the census tract level and
   export it as a GEOJSON for integration into my web application.


## Technologies used

Which technologies covered in class (or discovered on your own!) do you
plan to use? How do you anticipate using each of these technologies?

Review the APIs/online examples of leaflet, turf, jQuery, underscore (or
any library not explicitly covered in class) for functions/uses which
you'd like to explore. Briefly describe how you might use them.

1. jQuery: loading the data,
  - ajax calls
  - parsing the GEOJSON files
  - appending or replacing text in the free floating window
  - various click events, feeding functions into clicks
2. leaflet
  - L.map, setting the view when necessary
  - Working with polylines (the subway stops)
  - Working with a vector layer (a census tract)
  - Adding and removing layers to the map
  - Styling the vector and polyline files (colors, line weight etc.)
  - Potentially adding circle markers at subway stops
  - Filtering feature data
3. underscore
  -_.each when performing loops in functions
  -_.map as necessary to adjust values in the data
4. Bootstrap for layout and design help

## Design spec

#### User experience

Users of this application will be those interested in exploring the relationship between real estate prices and
transit connectivity in New York City. This could be real estate agents, property managers, those in the market to
rent or purchase property or academics and planners looking to gain a more thorough understanding of the property
market.

This is an example that hits at the core theme of my application, although visually represents it in a slightly
different format: http://projects.newyorker.com/story/subway/

Functionality overview and user work flow:
1. Bottom bar will allow you to select a subway line (visualized as circles as per MTA design)
2. Clicking on subway line will cause it to appear on the map.
3. Will highlight census tracts near the line.
4. Click a stop on that line to make only the tracts around that stop appear.
5. Popup window shows Median Rent for each of the highlighted census tracts.

#### Layouts and visual design

Static page elements:
1. Top Banner with map title
2. Map will occupy full width of screen.
3. Bottom bar will contain selection options as subway lines.
4. Free floating window will display results (try to have it dynamically size based on the amount
   of information to display?)

Interactivity and new visuals:
1. As a line is selected it will display on the map with corresponding subway stops.
2. As a stop is selected information about that census tract will appear in the free floating window.
3. Associated census tracts may  be highlighted physically on the map as the user selects lines and stops.
   I'm still considering how best to visually display the information.

## Anticipated difficulties

1. Coming up with a clean visualization of the data.
2. Constructing the relationship between lines, stops and census tracts. I'm not sure if this is something
   I need to build into the data on my own, or whether there are functions I can use to spatially evaluate the
   relationship between these two GEOJson files.
3. Landing on the most practical way to structure the various functions associated with each click of a subway line.


## Missing pieces

It would be useful to understand how to work with multiple datasets in a given project.
So far I think we've covered how to work with one dataset, but say we want to visualize two datasets
at a time or perform joins between the two, I'm unclear as to how that would work, or whether it would
require different functionality than we're already covered. Or whether it's even possible at all.
